# discord-counters
 bots that will count to infinity

1. make two discord bots with read and send permissions, and assign them roles to block them from all channels except one, unless you want them to reply to every number sent in every channel.
2. add your tokens where it says to add them in both of the main.py files
3. run them both, in two seperate terminal windows
